    <p>Lesson One: A Puma at Large</p>
    <p>
        Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. <br/>
        <br/>
        When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. <br/>
        <br/>
        However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the description given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar. <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. <br/>
        <br/>
        It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. <br/>
        <br/>
        The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. <br/>
        <br/>
        Whereever it went, it left behind a trail of dead deer and small animal like rabbits.<br/>
        <br/>
        Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noise' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. <br/>
        <br/>
        The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? <br/>
        <br/>
        As no puma had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. <br/>
        <br/>
        The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. <br/>
        <br/>
        It is disturbing to think that a dangerous animal is still at large in the quiet countryside<br/>
